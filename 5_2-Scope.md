# SCOPE

Interactive tutorial available at [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/lessons/scope/exercises/scope)

## SCOPE
An important idea in programming is *scope*. Scope defines where variables can be accessed or referenced. While some variables can be accessed from anywhere within a program, other variables may only be available in a specific context.

You can think of scope like the view of the night sky from your window. Everyone who lives on the planet Earth is in the global scope of the stars. The stars are accessible *globally*. Meanwhile, if you live in a city, you may see the city skyline or the river. The skyline and river are only accessible *locally* in your city, but you can still see the stars that are available globally.

Over the next few exercises, we’ll explore how scope relates to variables and learn best practices for variable declaration.
## BLOCKS AND SCOPE
Before we talk more about scope, we first need to talk about *blocks*.

We’ve seen blocks used before in functions and `if` statements. A block is the code found inside a set of curly braces `{}`. Blocks help us group one or more statements together and serve as an important structural marker for our code.

A block of code could be a function, like this:
```js
const logSkyColor = () => {
  let color = 'blue'; 
  console.log(color); // blue 
};
```

Notice that the function body is actually a block of code.

Observe the block in an `if` statement:
```js
if (dusk) {
  let color = 'pink';
  console.log(color); // pink
};
```

In the next few exercises, we’ll see how blocks define the scope of variables.

### INSTRUCTIONS
1. At the top of **main.js**, declare a `const` variable, named `city` set equal to `'New York City'`. This variable will exist *outside* of the block.
2. Below the `city` variable, write a function named `logCitySkyline`.
3. Inside of the function body of `logCitySkyline()`, write another variable using `let` named `skyscraperand` set it equal to `'Empire State Building'`.
4. Inside the function, include a return statement like this:
    ```js
    return 'The stars over the ' + skyscraper + ' in ' + city;
    ```

1. Beneath the `logCitySkyline()` function, use `console.log()` to log the value of `logCitySkyline()` to the console.

You’ll notice that the `logCitySkyline()` function is able to access both variables without any problems. In the next exercise we’ll consider why would it be preferable to have one variable outside of a block and the other inside of a block.

## GLOBAL SCOPE
Scope is the context in which our variables are declared. We think about scope in relation to blocks because variables can exist either outside of or within these blocks.

In GLOBAL SCOPE, variables are declared outside of blocks. These variables are called GLOBAL variables. Because global variables are not bound inside a block, they can be accessed by any code in the program, including code in blocks.

Let’s take a look at an example of global scope:
```js
const color = 'blue'

const returnSkyColor = () => {
  return color; // blue 
};

console.log(returnSkyColor()); // blue
```

- Even though the `color` variable is defined outside of the block, it can be accessed in the function block, giving it global scope.
- In turn, `color` can be accessed within the `returnSkyColor` function block.

Let’s work with global variables to see how data can be accessible from any place within a program.

### INSTRUCTIONS
1. At the top of **main.js**, write three global variables:
    - Name the first variable `satellite` and set it equal to `'The Moon'`.
    - Name the second variable `galaxy` and set it equal to `'The Milky Way'`.
    - Name the third variable `stars` and set it equal to `'North Star'`.
2. Below the variables created in the previous step, write a function named `callMyNightSky`. Inside the function, include a return statement like this:
    ```js
    return 'Night Sky: ' + satellite + ', ' + stars + ', and ' + galaxy;
    ```
3. Beneath the `callMyNightSky()` function, use `console.log()` to log the value of `callMyNightSky()` to the console.

    You’ll notice that the function block for `callMyNightSky()` is able to access the global variables freely since the variables are available to all lines of code in the file.

## BLOCK SCOPE
The next context we’ll cover is *block scope*. When a variable is defined inside a block, it is only accessible to the code within the curly braces `{}`. We say that variable has *block scope* because it is *only* accessible to the lines of code within that block.

Variables that are declared with block scope are known as *local variables* because they are only available to the code that is part of the same block.

Block scope works like this:
```js
const logSkyColor = () => {
  let color = 'blue'; 
  console.log(color); // blue 
};

logSkyColor(); // blue 
console.log(color); // ReferenceError
```

You’ll notice:

- We define a function `logSkyColor()`.
- Within the function, the `color` variable is only available within the curly braces of the function.
- If we try to log the same variable outside the function, throws a `ReferenceError`.

### INSTRUCTIONS
1. In **main.js**, define a function `logVisibleLightWaves()`.
2. Within the `logVisibleLightWaves()` function, using `const`, create a variable `lightWaves` and set it equal to `'Moonlight'`.
3. Within the `logVisibleLightWaves()` function, beneath the `lightWaves` variable, add a `console.log()` statement that will log the value of the `lightWaves` variable when the function runs.
4. Call the `logVisibleLightWaves()` function from outside the function.
5. Beneath the function call, log the value of lightWavesto the console from outside the function.

    You’ll notice that it logs a `ReferenceError` since the variable is tied to the block scope of the function.

## SCOPE POLLUTION
It may seem like a great idea to always make your variables accessible, but having too many global variables can cause problems in a program.

When you declare global variables, they go to the *global namespace*. The global namespace allows the variables to be accessible from anywhere in the program. These variables remain there until the program finishes which means our global namespace can fill up really quickly.

*Scope* pollution is when we have too many global variables that exist in the global namespace, or when we reuse variables across different scopes. Scope pollution makes it difficult to keep track of our different variables and sets us up for potential accidents. For example, globally scoped variables can collide with other variables that are more locally scoped, causing unexpected behavior in our code.

Let’s look at an example of scope pollution in practice so we know how to avoid it:
```js
let num = 50;
console.log(num);
const logNum = () => {
  num = 100; // Take note of this line of code
  console.log(num);
};
logNum()
Console.log(num)
logNum(); // Prints 100
console.log(num); // Prints 100
```

You’ll notice:

- We have a variable `num`.
- Inside the function body of `logNum()`, we want to declare a new variable but forgot to use the `let` keyword.
- When we call `logNum()`, `num` gets reassigned to `100`.
- The reassignment inside `logNum()` affects the global variable `num`.
- Even though the reassignment is allowed and we won’t get an error, if we decided to use `num` later, we’ll unknowingly use the new value of `num`.

While it’s important to know what global scope is, it’s best practice to not define variables in the global scope.

### INSTRUCTIONS
1. Let’s see what happens if we create a variable that overwrites a global variable.

    Inside the `callMyNightSky()` function, on the very first line of the function body, assign the variable stars to 'Sirius' as such:
    ```js
    stars = 'Sirius';
    ```
2. Outside the function, under the current `console.log()` statement, add another `console.log()` statement to log `stars` to the console.

    You’ll notice that the global variable `stars` was reassigned to `'Sirius'`. In other words, we changed the value of the global `stars` variable but it’s not easy to read what exactly happened. This is bad practice in code maintainability and could impact our program in ways we do not intend.

## PRACTICE GOOD SCOPING
Given the challenges with global variables and scope pollution, we should follow best practices for scoping our variables as tightly as possible using block scope.

Tightly scoping your variables will greatly improve your code in several ways:

- It will make your code more legible since the blocks will organize your code into discrete sections.
- It makes your code more understandable since it clarifies which variables are associated with different parts of the program rather than having to keep track of them line after line!
- It’s easier to maintain your code, since your code will be modular.
- It will save memory in your code because it will cease to exist after the block finishes running.

Here’s another example of how to use block scope, as defined within an if block:
```js
const logSkyColor = () => {
  const dusk = true;
  let color = 'blue'; 
  if (dusk) {
    let color = 'pink';
    console.log(color); // pink
  }
  console.log(color); // blue 
};

console.log(color); // ReferenceError
```

Here, you’ll notice:

We create a variable `dusk` inside the `logSkyColor()` function.

- After the `if` statement, we define a new code block with the `{}` braces. Here we assign a new value to the variable `color` if the `if` statement is truthy.
- Within the `if` block, the `color` variable holds the value `'pink'`, though outside the `if` block, in the function body, the `color` variable holds the value `'blue'`.
- While we use block scope, we still pollute our namespace by reusing the same variable name twice. A better practice would be to rename the variable inside the block.

Block scope is a powerful tool in JavaScript, since it allows us to define variables with precision, and not pollute the global namespace. If a variable does not need to exist outside a block— it shouldn’t!

### INSTRUCTIONS
1. Inside the function body of `logVisibleLightWaves()`, beneath the `region` variable and before the provided `console.log()` statement, create an `if` statement that checks if the `region` is the `'The Arctic'`.
2. Inside the `if` block, define a new `let` variable `lightWaves` and set it equal to `'Northern Lights'`.
3. Beneath the variable in the `if` block, use `console.log()` to log the value of the block variable inside the if block.

    Run your code and notice the output. Inside the `if` block `console.log(lightWaves)` logs the value `Northern Lights` to the console. Outside the `if` block, but still within the function, the same statement logs `Moonlight` to the console.

## REVIEW SCOPE
In this lesson, you learned about scope and how it impacts the accessibility of different variables.

Let’s review the following terms:

- **Scope** is the idea in programming that some variables are accessible/inaccessible from other parts of the program.
- **Blocks** are statements that exist within curly braces `{}`.
- Global **scope** refers to the context within which variables are accessible to every part of the program.
- Global **variables** are variables that exist within global scope.
- Block **scope** refers to the context within which variables that are accessible only within the block they are defined.
- Local **variables** are variables that exist within block scope.
- **Global namespace** is the space in our code that contains globally scoped information.
- Scope **pollution** is when too many variables exist in a namespace or variable names are reused.

As you continue your coding journey, remember to use best practices when declaring your variables! Scoping your variables tightly will ensure that your code has clean, organized, and modular logic.
